description: >
  Start here if this is your first time using FaaSr. You'll learn the basic   
  philosophy behind Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and how FaaSr can help 
  simplify the development and deployment of FaaS-ready workflows using R.

Many applications developed in R can benefit from:

* Encapsulation of R functions and its dependences in Docker containers

* Composition of multiple R functions into workflows

* Automated cloud deployment of workflows without requiring server management

* Dynamic invocation of workflows based on events such as timers

* Support for cloud services for data storage, retrieval, and external access

FaaSr is a package that makes it easy for developers to create R functions and workflows that can run in the cloud.

* It is built to work with Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud computing

* It allows you to write R code once and create workflows that can be deployed on both widely-used commercial (GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda) and open-source platforms (OpenWhisk). 

* It is also built to work with cloud storage, and provides simple primitives for data access using AWS S3 and Apache Arrow

With FaaSr, you can focus on developing R functions and compose workflows, and leave dealing with the idiosyncrasies of different FaaS platforms and their APIs to the FaaSr package.
